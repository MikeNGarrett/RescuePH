# The plan

## v1
Twitter search for RescuePH that hones down results to just what’s important.

__The goal is to provide a better twitter search tool that many people can use at the same time.__

## v2
Attempt to pull out information if possible in this format: "RescuePH < Name of person to rescue > < address, municipality>”
Attempt to pull out location data (if available).
Ability to mute accounts.

__The goal is to add features that will further enhance these results.__

## v3
Database integration (likely WordPress).

__The goal is to provide a platform that other services can use and the data can be worked with and displayed in different ways from one place.__

## v4
Tweets become nodes that have additional data associated, e.g. legitimate help request, urgency, location data, etc.
Views are built for different needs, e.g. list of recent requests available on a mobile device.

__The goal is to give volunteers the tools to organize tweets and push them out in different ways.__

v5
Build in more robust location data, e.g. what’s the most recent request closest to me?
Build in ability to notify that help is on the way (this may be problematic in more ways than one)

__The goal is to improve rescue response and status__



# Specifics
__v1__
Oauth shouldn't be need here. I'm setting up an app that will rate-limit requests and save them to a flat file.
The user-facing application will then use these flat files for any interaction.
I'm going to limit the search to rescueph (sans hashtag) and eliminate retweets.
